<h1 class="title">Practical Arrangements for Pure Maths Colloquium at Southampton</h1>
<div class="cath">

<ul>
<li>The colloquia start at <b>3pm on Fridays</b>; room <b>46/2005 (L/T C)</b> (in the physics building, number <b>46</b>) on Highfield campus - directions and maps are below. We aim to have them in a hybrid form, i.e. broadcast the talk over zoom to colleagues who can't make it in person; some of the talks are over zoom only.</li>
<li>The length of the talk is 50 minutes (can go up to an hour).</li>
<li>The colloquium will be attended by pure mathematics staff and research
students. Please include some <i>introductory material</i> suitable for a
first year research student (cca the <i>first half</i> of the talk at
least).</li>
<li>A bit more about the audience: it's usually altogether between 15 and 25 people (yes - the name of the series is a bit too fancy).
The staff work mostly in geometric group theory, topology, and a little of bit of coarse geometry, functional analysis/noncommutative geometry, and algebraic geometry.
The PhD students and postdocs naturally match these areas.</li>
<li>The room has blackboards and a projector + PC (so you can use beamer, either from our PC if you bring your presentation on a USB stick; or you can connect your own laptop). An overhead projector can be arranged. <!--Please note that the blackboards, when lifted up, cover the area that the projector uses. To get an idea,-->
<!--here are two photos of the room: <a href="static/8c-blackboards.jpg">with the blackboards up</a>, <a href="static/8c-projector.jpg">with the projector on</a>.-->
<!--<a href="https://data.southampton.ac.uk/room/54-7033.html">here</a> can be found a photo of how the front of the room looks like (there are actually two blackboards of the same size, one behind the other, and both can be moved up/down).-->
</li>
<li>Please forward me the <i>title</i> and an <i>abstract</i> for you talk some time
in advance of the colloquium (so that we can advertise it).</li>
<li>Please let me know about your travel arrangements, particularly if
you&rsquo;d like me to arrange a hotel for an overnight stay.</li>
<li>We would be happy if you could join us for a <i>lunch</i> (usually around
12:30) and/or a <i>dinner</i> in the evening.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="travel-information">Travel information</h2>
<ul>
<li>The easiest way of getting around Southampton is by buses, particularly UniLink lines. Both Southampton Central train station and Southampton Airport are served by U1 line; the University is between those two.</li>
<li>From the <i>train station</i>: if you leave by platform 4, the bus stop is almost in front of you. Take U1A (A = towards the airport); the main University stop is called &ldquo;Highfield interchange&rdquo;, it takes about 20 minutes.</li>
<li>If your train stops at the <i>Southampton Airport Parkway Station</i>, you may consider using it: the airport U1 bus stop is just across the road from this station and the bus ride is shorter than from the central train station. This applies to taxis as well.</li>
<li>From the <i>airport</i>: the bus stop is in front of the terminal. Take U1C (C = towards the centre); the main University stop is called &ldquo;Highfield interchange&rdquo;, it takes about 15 minutes.</li>
<li>The timetable for the U1 line can be viewed <a href="https://www.unilinkbus.co.uk/services/UNIL/U1A?direction=outbound">online here</a>; or you can use their <a href="https://www.unilinkbus.co.uk/plan-your-journey">search thing</a> to view live times.</li>
<li>A bus ticket can be purchased from the driver, it costs £2.30. A &ldquo;day rider&rdquo; ticket is £3.80. The driver will return change, so exact change is not necessary. It can be also paid with contactless (but please ask for a paper ticket so that we can reimburse for it).</li>
<li>The Highfield interchange is in front of building 6, Maths building has number <b>54</b>. <a href="https://maps.southampton.ac.uk">Campus map</a>.</li>
<li>If you intend to come by a <i>car</i>, please let me know, and I will (attempt to) reserve parking for you on campus.</li>
<li>The primary Pure Mathematics Colloquium organiser is Jan Spakula, office number <b>8027</b> (on the 8th floor).</li>

<li>For reimbursing expenses, please fill out
<a href="static/AP04-expenses-nonuni.pdf">a form (pdf)</a>
<!-- (same form as <a href="static/AP04-expenses-nonuni.docx">word doc</a>)-->; and also
<a href="static/AP07-bankinfo.pdf">bank info form (pdf)</a>
<!--(same in <a href="static/AP07-bankinfo.docx">word doc</a>)-->.</li>
<li>Please send the form with receipts to me: Jan Spakula, School of
Mathematics, University of Southampton, Highfield, Southampton, SO17
1BJ</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can just email me a scan of a signed form, along with scans/pdfs of the receipts. In this case, please hang on to the originals for a while!
</ul>

<h2 id="hotel">Hotel</h2>
<p>
If you had us book a hotel for you, most likely you&rsquo;ll be staying at the
<!--
<a href="https://elizabethhousehotel.com/">Elizabeth House Hotel</a>. It&rsquo;s about 25 minute walk from the department (2km) along a park; and it&rsquo;s
on the UniLink U1 line (mentioned above; the stop is between the Highfield
campus (that&rsquo;s where the department is) and the Central train station).
-->
<a href="">Jurys Inn Southampton</a>. It's about 40 minute walk to the department (2 miles - sorry), half of it along a park; about 15 mins walk to the train station and close to the city centre.
There are bus stops 4-5 mins walk from the hotel that are on UniLink bus routes to campus: either U1 or U2 on London Road, or U6 near the RSH Hospital.
